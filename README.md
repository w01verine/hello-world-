# hello-world-
tutorial made me do it :)
Im the lucky husband of the woman of my dreams. We have 4 beautiful children together, 3 boys and one girl. I am eager to continue a path in the it field. I have a couple of years experience doing some work already including testing. Developing websites is an area in particular I would like to continueto get better at. My biggest fear is my brain stopping working :).
